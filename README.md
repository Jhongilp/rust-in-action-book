# [RUST IN ACTION BOOK (Tim McNamara)](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action)

## Chapters 3

In this chapter I learnt about:

- struct
- enums
- traits

## struct
An struct allow us to store several properties

```
struct File {
    name: String,
    data: Vec<u8>,
    state: FileState
}
```
